# IPHYRE
The `iphyre` package is built to explore interactive physical reasoning. Useful APIs are provided to support playing, data collection and learning.

IPHYRE benchmark contains 40 interactive physics games composed mainly of gray blocks, black blocks, blue blacks, and red balls. These games share the same goal of getting the red balls into the abyss, which can be reached by eliminating gray blocks (the only ones that can be eliminated). Besides the fixed static blocks (gray and black), we add dynamic blue blocks moving under gravity, springs, and pendulum bars to the environment to extensively enrich the physical dynamics.
